I am eager to build a career in DevOps and grow my technical skills. With my passion for learning and problem-solving, I am committed to applying the knowledge gained to real-world projects and advancing in the tech industry.



I hope to gain a strong foundation in DevOps practices, master essential tools like Git and CI/CD pipelines, and gain experiences to prepare for real-world challenges.
