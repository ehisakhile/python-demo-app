My name is Samuel Okonkwo
I think I should be considered because of my passion for DevOps and it’s potential to transform the way organizations deliver software, but passion is not enough so I’m dedicated to learning, able to work with a team, and also success driven.
I expect to learn a lot from this bootcamp, some of them are; the foundational concepts, introduction to what DevOps is, the history, principles, the tools and technologies, hands-on projects and exercises, the best practices and industry trends, and also I expect to be introduced to problem solving and collaboration.
