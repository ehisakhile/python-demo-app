I possess a strong passion for learning and a clear vision for my career in DevOps and cloud technologies. I am committed to gaining hands-on experience with tools like AWS, Docker and Kubernetes and I am also dedicated to mastering the technical skills needed for success.

I look forward to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate effectively and support others in their learning journeys. By fostering meaningful relationships and sharing my knowledge, I aim to contribute positively to the program and its community while growing both personally and professionally.
