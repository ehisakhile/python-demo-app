# About Me

My name is Emmanuel Uwayo.  

I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, but I havenâ€™t yet had the opportunity to advance further toward my goal of becoming a cloud engineer.  
I believe this training will provide the perfect platform to help me learn and apply core concepts such as:  
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines  
- Networking  
- System Administration  

Additionally, I aim to gain hands-on experience in using GitHub scripts for automation.
