My name is Philip Ayanfe. I'm a Software Developer with experience in C# .Net Applications and React. I would love to be part of this program to improve my development skills and also augment in the area of devops and cloud infracstructure. I expect to learn the more of AWS and AZURE as i have some partial knowledge. I also intend to learn more of the devops practices and gain a certificate in AWS or AZURE
