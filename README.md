My name is Afeez Olalekan Azeez
I am applying to the Practical DevOps bootcamp to gain hands-on expereince in DevOps solutions.
I have attended some training and completed some certifications but the hands on is missing for me.
I expect that with this bootcamp, I will be able to leverage on the strenght of others in having hnadson expereince by working on projects that can help me become a DevOps engineer.
