# Beginner Level Bootcamp Assessment DevOps Challenge

## Ndidi Esther Chibogu

**I am eager to join the DevOps bootcamp because I am deeply passionate about leveraging automation and collaboration to streamline development and operations processes. My background in software development and software quality assurance has given me a strong foundation in the technical aspects of building and managing systems, and I am now eager to expand my skill set to include modern DevOps practices. Recently, Iâ€™ve become increasingly interested in automation and how it can streamline testing and development processes. This curiosity has led me to pursue learning automation testing, and I now seek to expand my knowledge further by transitioning into the field of DevOps. I am excited to explore how DevOps practices can integrate development, testing, and operations to create more efficient, scalable, and reliable systems.**

**Through my current role, I have gained insight into the critical importance of streamlined workflows, automated testing, and continuous feedback loops to improve product quality and reduce time to market. I have been particularly drawn to the ways in which DevOps principles, such as continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and infrastructure automation, can not only improve team productivity but also lead to more stable, secure, and scalable applications.**

**By participating in the DevOps bootcamp, I expect to gain hands-on experience with key DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform. I aim to learn how to effectively implement CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and explore cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure to better manage infrastructure and scale applications. I am particularly excited about learning how to automate repetitive tasks, improve deployment workflows, and ensure system reliability through continuous monitoring and logging. Additionally, I am eager to explore how security can be integrated seamlessly into the development lifecycle through DevSecOps practices.**

**This boot camp offers the ideal environment to develop these skills in a collaborative, hands-on setting, and I am confident that the knowledge I gain will empower me to contribute to the creation of more efficient, automated, and resilient systems while fostering stronger collaboration between development, QA, and operations teams. Ultimately, I aspire to be part of a team that builds robust, automated, and scalable systems, and I am excited to take the next step in my career through this intensive, focused training.**
